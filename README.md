Design/Generate/ReverseEngineer/Compare/Analyze

"Apricot DB" is a database tool for design and analysis of the relational database structure. 
It represents the DB- structure in the form of editable Entity/Relationship Diagrams (ERD). 
"Apricot DB" allows to perform reverse engineering on the existing database, as well as to create 
a new database structure from scratch. Allows to generate the essential DDL- scripts for 
CREATE/DROP/DELETE- operations based on the current ERD.
