"Apricot DB" is a database tool for design and analysis of the relational database structure. It represents the DB- structure in the form of editable Entity/Relationship Diagrams (ERD). "Apricot DB" allows to perform reverse engineering on the existing database, as well as to create a new database structure from scratch. Allows to generate the essential DDL- scripts for CREATE/DROP/DELETE- operations based on the current ERD.
The graphical representation of ER Diagrams complies with the IDEF1x- standard.
The current version (0.3 Alpha, the develop branch), includes most of the essential functions planned for "ApricotDB".
