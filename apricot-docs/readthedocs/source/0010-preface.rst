"Apricot DB" is a simple but powerful tool for the database design, based on Entity Relationship paradigm.
"Apricot DB" allows to design- analyse- script- and document the relational database.

"Apricot DB" has been developed for multiple roles existing in the IT- projects: analysts, database designers, developers, testers and business users. 

The modern database can include hundreds and even thousands of tables and relationships between them. Very often the structure of the database needs to be analysed, documented and altered.
"Apricot DB" was designed to support the big database structures from all popular providers, with high stability and performance.

The database structure is a set of tables, connected with each other by the relationships. 

.. note::
   The terms "tables" and "entities" have been used in this document as synonyms. 

A simple idea of the Entity Relationship Diagram lies at the background of the graphical representation of the database structure.

The main functions of "Apricot DB":

* create new or edit the existing database structures using the graphical editor;
* reverse engineer of the existing (physical) database into the ApricotDB Project; 
* compare different versions of the same database;
* generate the database scripts for different purposes: create/drop the tables, delete data, compare and modify different versions of the same database;
* import/export the projects from/to the local file. Export the diagrams into graphic format and PDF;
* synchronize the project with the remote Git based repository;
* generate the detailed Excel- report, which reflects all the entities, fields, constraints, indexes and relationships included into the database;
* store all database design information produced by the user in a well structured projects (the ApricotDB Project).
