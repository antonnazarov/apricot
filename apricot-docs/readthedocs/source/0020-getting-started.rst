Getting Started with "Apricot DB"
---------------------------------

History of the Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I've started "Apricot DB" in Augist 2018. It was growing from a little database utility, which was migrated in years through multiple designs, functionalities and the programming languages.

Since August 2018 "Apricot DB" uses Java and Spring Framework with graphical user's interface implemented on JavaFX. The project went through several major Releases.
I've been carefully checking the feedbacks recaived from the Users, implementing the bug fixes and the new features accordingly. 
At any moment of time "Apricot DB" has been compiled against the latest versions of Java Machine and includes the latest versions of the third party frameworks.

"Apricot DB" has the development site: http://apricotdb.co.za/. There are some thoughts regarding the application design and the project- history notes.
